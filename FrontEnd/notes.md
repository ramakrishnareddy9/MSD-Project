- Capture more value by controlling their pricing

### 2. **Customers** (End Consumers)

- May also list value-added products on the platform
- Focus on supply consistency and cost-efficiency
- Place large, scheduled orders

### 4. **Restaurant Partners** (B2B Clients)
- Recurring B2B clients
- Order fresh produce frequently for daily menu needs

- Handles long-distance transportation (village to city hubs)
- Uses trucks and cold-chain logistics
- Manages inter-city and rural-to-urban freight
- Ensures produce freshness during long-haul transport

#### Small-Scale Delivery

## B2B vs B2C Dynamics

### B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Model
- **Target**: Individual consumers
- **Order Size**: Smaller, personal use quantities
- **Frequency**: More frequent, on-demand
- **Focus**: Convenience and variety
- **Delivery**: Last-mile delivery to homes
- **Pricing**: Listed prices plus delivery fees

### B2B (Business-to-Business) Model
- **Target**: Businesses (restaurants, retailers, corporate kitchens)
- **Order Size**: Large, bulk quantities
- **Frequency**: Scheduled, recurring orders
- **Focus**: Supply consistency and cost-efficiency
- **Delivery**: Scheduled bulk deliveries (often early morning)
- **Pricing**: Negotiated bulk prices (often lower per unit)

### Key Differences
| Aspect | B2B | B2C |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Order Size | Large, bulk | Small, personal |
| Frequency | Scheduled, recurring | On-demand, frequent |
| Customer Type | Businesses, restaurants | Individual consumers |
| Procurement Focus | Consistency, cost-efficiency | Convenience, variety |
| Delivery Schedule | Planned, early morning | On-demand, flexible |

### Benefits of Dual Model
- Farmers can tap both local retail and wholesale markets
- Expanded market reach for producers
- Flexible selling options (e.g., surplus to consumers, bulk to companies)
- Maximized revenue opportunities

## Logistics and Distribution

### Multi-Tier Supply Chain

#### 1. **Farm to Hub** (Long-Haul)
- Large-scale delivery partners manage this segment
- Refrigerated trucks or containers for perishables
- Inter-city and rural-to-urban freight
- Cold-chain logistics to maintain freshness
- Transport from farms to city distribution centers

#### 2. **Hub to Customer** (Last-Mile)
- Small-scale couriers handle local delivery
- City fulfillment centers (FCs) and dark stores
- Local vans/bikes for final delivery
- Flexible, agile service for quick delivery
- Serves both businesses and individual customers

### Distribution Network Structure
```
Farms â†’ Refrigerated Trucks (Long-Haul) â†’ City Hubs/FCs â†’
