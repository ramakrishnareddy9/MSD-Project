## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

All routes implement:
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** - `authenticate` middleware
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - `authorize` middleware
- ✅ **Ownership Verification** - Users can only access their own data
- ✅ **Admin Override** - Admins have full access

### Payment Routes Security
```javascript
// Example: Only buyer can create payment
if (String(order.buyerId) !== String(req.user._id) && !req.user.roles.includes('admin')) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
}
```

### Price Agreement Routes Security
```javascript
// Example: Role-based filtering
if (req.user.roles.includes('farmer')) {
  query.sellerId = req.user._id; // Only see agreements where they are seller
} else if (req.user.roles.includes('business')) {
  query.buyerId = req.user._id; // Only see agreements where they are buyer
}
```

## 🎯 Business Logic Implemented

### Payment Lifecycle
```
1. Create Payment (pending)
   ↓
2. Process with Gateway
   ↓
3a. Success → Update Order (confirmed)
3b. Failed → Record Failure
   ↓
4. (Optional) Refund → Update Status
```

### Price Agreement Workflow
```
1. Create Agreement (draft)
   ↓
2. Review by Seller
   ↓
3a. Activate → Available for orders
3b. Reject → Mark as rejected
   ↓
4. Apply to B2B Orders (automatic price calculation)
```

## ✅ Validation & Error Handling

### Input Validation
- ✅ All POST/PUT routes validate input using express-validator
- ✅ ObjectId validation for all :id parameters
- ✅ Business logic validation (dates, amounts, quantities)
- ✅ Ownership verification before mutations

### Error Responses
```javascript
// Example error response
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid quantity. Minimum order quantity is 100"
}

// Validation error response
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    { "field": "tiers", "message": "At least one pricing tier is required" },
    { "field": "validFrom", "message": "Valid from date is required" }
  ]
}
```
